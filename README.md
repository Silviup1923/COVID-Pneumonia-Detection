## 🔍 About the AI Model

COVID-Pneumonia-Detection uses a deep learning model called ResNet34. This model analyzes patterns in medical images to find signs of COVID pneumonia. It was trained with thousands of images and achieves 99.5% sensitivity. 

Key points:

- Works with standard X-ray and CT images.
- Fast processing — takes only seconds per image.
- Designed for emergency screening where speed and accuracy matter.
- Built with PyTorch, a popular AI framework.

---

## 💡 Tips for Best Results

- Use clear, high-quality X-ray or CT images.
- Avoid blurry or compressed image files.
- Make sure the image shows the lungs clearly.
- This tool is for screening only. Always confirm with professional medical advice.
- Regularly update the software from the release page for improvements.
